# Word and Letter Counter

## ðŸ”´ Aim
The **Word and Letter Counter** is an application that counts the number of words and letters in a given text and displays the counts dynamically as you type.

## ðŸ”´ Tech Stack
- **React.js**: Frontend framework for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **HTML**: For structuring the web content.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.

## ðŸ”´ Features
- **Word Counting**: Counts the number of words in the text.
- **Letter Counting**: Counts the number of letters, excluding special characters and spaces.
- **Real-time Updates**: Updates word and letter counts dynamically as you type.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to various screen sizes.

## ðŸ”´ How to Run

1. **Install Node.js** (if not already installed): [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).
   
2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd word-letter-counter
  
3. **Install dependencies**:
   
```
npm install
```

The app should open automatically in your browser at ``` http://localhost:3000.```

## ðŸ”´ How It Works
